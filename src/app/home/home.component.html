  <h4>Congratulations, you've made it to my site!</h4>
  <p class="plainText">
    Why don't you check out the content I've built just for you?

  <ul>
    <li>Want to learn more about me on the about page?</li>
    <li>Perhaps my product roadmap is more up your alley?</li>
    <li>
      Or better yet, take a leaf out of Guy Raz and check out How I Built This (
      Guy- still waiting on that interview mate... )
    </li>
