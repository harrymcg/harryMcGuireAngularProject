# read me info:
This is a basic web app built to learn how to use angular. that's it.

# outstanding questions.
1. Is the best way to release the app by going via azure dev ops pipelines? see here: https://medium.com/ngconf/angular-on-azure-part-i-d842e8f76462
2. When using angular, how d you build a "home" page? do you use the app.component component, or create a new component? If you leave as app.component, how do you route to that component? I had massive troubles, so created a home component (port 4200/home), but now if you go just to port 4200, you get nothing...
3. Do you leverage styles.css for all central styles? If so, does the app.component stylesheet ONLY control that particular sheet? I'm confused by the hierarchy here
4. Tactical: why is my nav bar "scrollable"? i can't find which element has the problem of being too wide...
